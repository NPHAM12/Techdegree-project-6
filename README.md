# Meeting Expectation

Using Node.js, Express, and Pug template to create a portfolio site to showcase the great projects I've built.
The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where I'll have a chance to share contact info, practice my elevator pitch and talk a little about myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least my first five projects from this Techdegree.
